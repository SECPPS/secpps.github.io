Software plays an increasingly important role in assuring effective and efficient operation of industrial automation engineering systems. However, software engineering methods applied in this field lag behind the conventional software engineering methods, where tremendous progress has been made in the last years.

The workshop series on **Software Engineering in Cyber-Physical Production Systems (SECPPS)** aims at discussing new approaches and methods for the design of software for use in the production systems domain, which shall incorporate the latest trends from the software engineering domain. 
The workshop series addresses the challenges in adopting state-of-the-art software engineering tools and techniques in the automation domain and discuss various approaches to tackle the issues. Particularly, we are currently facing a dramatically increasing complexity in the development and operation of systems with the emergence of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS). This demands for more comprehensive and systematic views on all aspects of systems (e.g., mechanics, electronics, software, and network) not only in the engineering process, but in the operation process as well. Moreover, flexible approaches are needed to adapt the systemsâ€™ behavior to ever-changing requirements and tasks, unexpected conditions, as well as structural transformations.

## Collaborative Space/Results

In the course of the series, we set up a Google Drive Folder in which we collected the results of the workshops (notes, drawings, presentations). 
We also set up a Github repository to collect reading material (SECPPS Body of Knowledge). Access to both is restricted. 
Please join our initiative to get access, e.g., be registering for and participating in one of the next editions of our workshop series (see below) or by contacting the organizers.
