#### Software-Engineering for Cyber-Physical Production Systems (SECPPS)
# Workshop 2025/2 -- Community Edition
#### ISW, Stuttgart, June 10th-12th, 2025

The community edition of the [SECPPS workshop series](/secpps-ws/) focuses on a constructive and
open exchange process to guide industry-relevant research and to help
transferring technological advances from research into industry. We welcome
academic and industrial participants to come together to summarize existing
work, identify new challenges, and discuss solution strategies. In a
co-creative process, we want to find ways to address emerging topics and
bring modern software engineering into industrial usage.

You are welcome to propose on-topic talks of maximum 30 minutes to present to
the audience. There are multiple slots available for you to present recent
advances or topics you are working on. The remainder of the workshop will
proceed in the [Barcamp](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcamp) format, with
a strong desire to create actionable output for the near future.

For more information regarding the workshop, especially for people who are
interested to attend for the first time, please contact [Nico Brandt](https://www.isw.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/team/Brandt-00001/)
