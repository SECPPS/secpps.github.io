# Workshop on Software Engineering for Cyber-Physical Production Systems (SECPPS)
9th Meeting of the SECPPS Community, 2nd edition at the SE conference

## About 
Software plays an essential part in the efficient operation of modern production systems. While variability and complexity represent key challenges for cyber-physical production systems,  software design in production systems is still a neglected topic. The SECPPS workshop series aims to promote modern software engineering solutions to the challenges of cyber-physical production systems and foster interdisciplinary discussion.

This workshop edition is co-located with [SE 2025](https://se2025.sdq.kastel.kit.edu/).

## Organizers
  * Bianca Wiesmayr (JKU Linz, AT)
  * Sandra Greiner (University of Southern Denmark, DK; University of Regensburg, D)
